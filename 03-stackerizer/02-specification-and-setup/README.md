## Notes

# Limited Vocabulary of S-expressions

1. `+` and `*` operators

2. Any numbers as arguments to these operators (significant: `stacker` can only
   operate on two arguments at a time)

3. Any degree of nesting

4. The `stackerizer` language only needs to handle a single expression as input

---

* Language that has no custom reader can be referred to as a `module language`
