# [The Expander](https://beautifulracket.com/stacker/the-expander.html)

## Notes

* Expander will do its work with the help of macros

* Macros happen at compile time, not run time

### Example Macro

```
(and cond-a cond-b cond-c)
```

gets expanded at compile time to:

```
(if cond-a
    (if cond-b
        cond-c
        #f)
    #f)
```

These nested `if` conditionals are what's actually executed at run time.

---

* A macro doesn't evaluate the code it gets as input, but implements a template
  to put items into certain positions.

* Macro just "rewrites" the code

### Three Golden Rules of Macros

1. At compile time, a macro takes one code fragment as input, and converts it
   to a new code fragment. The input & output code fragments are each packaged
   inside a syntax object.

2. Because compile time happens before run time, all macros operate before any
   run-time functions.

3. A macro can only treat its input code as a literal syntactic entity. It
   can't evaluate arguments or expressions within that code, because those
   values are only available at run time (which happens after compile time).

---

* Arguments and expressions within a code fragment passed to a macro don't
  exist yet, so cannot be used in any way.

* Because of restricted interface, macros less versatile than run time
  functions; a macro is not the tool of first resort.

* Macro system is Racket's crown jewel

* If the reader was responsible for the form of the code, we could say the
  expander is responsible for its meaning. The expanderâ€™s job is to prepare the
  code so Racket can evaluate it.

* Once an `identifier` has a `binding`, it becomes a `variable`

### Techniques within expander

1. Define macros to rewrite certain code as other code @ compile time

2. Define functions to be invoked @ run time

3. Import bindings from existing Racket modules (can include both macros and
   functions)

---

Expander needs to

1. Provide bindings for `handle`, `+`, and `*`

2. Implement a stack

3. Provide a special macro called `#%module-begin` (conventional)

---

* `#%module-begin` is like an analog to `read-syntax`
